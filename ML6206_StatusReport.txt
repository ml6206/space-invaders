The state of my work Space Invaders:
    My project is complete. The game works, but one problem left is that
    it runs slowly. I removed unnecessary codes and checked every function, but
    the program runs slower as I add more bullets to the screen. My theory
    is that using one turtle to perform all functions in the program made the
    animation run slow.

    My project meets the requirements specified in the project demo. The enemies
    move in the same type of pattern as shown in the demo. The space ship is
    controlled by the left and right arrow keys, and pressing the space key will
    cause the ship to shoot a single bullet.

    I added a status score of the number of enemies left as an additional
    feature.

    I'm not fully satisfied with the final results. There is still room left for
    improvement, but it meets the requirements.

My retrospective on the development process:
    Like the first status report, I think understanding the big picture and not
    making assumptions was the biggest challenge for me. But I learned not to do
    that and focused on making diagrams of the program's components on paper.
    It helped me to understand the connections in the program.

    I don't think any part of the assignement was easy, but I learned a lot and
    am proud of what I accomplished in this project.

Additional thoughts or questions:
    I've asked my professor, the PTC, and my TAs on how my program can run
    not slowly, but faster and smoothy. They suggested lowering the value of
    time.sleep in the main function. I know that anything in that function
    shouldn't be changed so I'm still confused on what I should do. If you can,
    please look at my program and send me feedback.
